6. Data and routing for Learner Credit Management feature
=========================================================

Status

Accepted

Context
*******

Within the designed user flow for the Learner Credit Management (LCM) feature, there are two primary pages:

**Overview**

Displays aggregate spend metadata for a single Learner Credit subsidy or a single legacy enterprise offer as a data visualization and with numbers displayed for percentage utilized and remaining funds. Lists the active "budgets" associated with the legacy enterprise offer or Learner Credit subsidy.

* This page is the default landing page for the Learner Credit Management feature.
* In the case of an enterprise offer, only a single "Budget" is displayed.
* For new Learner Credit, all active budgets (i.e., subsidy access policies) associated to the Learner Credit subsidy are displayed.
* Each "budget" displayed includes a "View budget" CTA that links users to the budget detail page route described below.

**Detail**

Displays detailed information about specific transactions (i.e., enrollments) related to the enterprise offer or Learner Credit subsidy, as well as aggregate stats around remaining balance and a similar data visualization specific to the budget.

* In the case of legacy enterprise offers, the singular detail page should display all transactions related to the offer. Although unlikely, this may include transactions across product lines (e.g., Open Courses vs. Executive Education).
* With new Learner Credit, each budget detail page represents a policy (i.e., budget) associated with the Learner Credit subsidy. These budgets are typically split between product line based on the enterprise catalog tied to the policy, such that the transactions displayed only include a single product line (i.e., Open Courses or Executive Education).

Data sources supporting current feature
#######################################

Currently, the data sources for the Learner Credit Management feature include:

* Enterprise offers API
* Enterprise subsidy API
* Analytics API

The LCM feature first makes an API call to ecommerce to retrieve any enterprise offers, but also makes a similar API call in parallel to enterprise-subsidy to retrieve any Learner Credit subsidies.

The Learner Credit Management feature's current design only supports either a single enterprise offer or a single Learner Credit subsidy. It does not currently intend to support more than one enterprise offer or more than one Learner Credit subsidy.

Currently, the only data source for the Learner Credit Management page, once we've identified if we're working with an enterprise offer or Learner Credit subsidy, is the data analytics API.

At the time of this writing, the analytics API returns data on a 12-hour delay. That is, the data warehouse processes the data backing the analytics API every 12 hours. This means that the data displayed on the Learner Credit Management page is currently on a 12-hour delay.

However, now that we are creating a user journey for enterprise administrators to take action on their Learner Credit spend via top-down content assignments, we will need to make these data more transactional (i.e., real-time) when working with new Learner Credit subsidies. That is, because the data supporting the feature is mutated by user behavior (e.g., enterprise admin assigns 10 learners to a course, deducting from the overall budget's remaining balance), we are no longer able to rely on the analytics API due to its fixed, 12-hour delay.

An additional challenge is the importance of data consistency between the overview and detail page routes, so they must rely on the same data sources. That is, if we change the data source for the detail page route to be more transactional, we must also change the overview page route to be more transactional in lock step together.

Decisions
*********

As the Learner Credit Management feature is available for users today, with the goal of displaying both Learner Credit budgets (policies) while remaining backwards compatible with enterprise offers, we will continue to rely on the analytics API in the short term. This implies the current approach to replicate data about budgets (policies) from enterprise-access to the data warehouse and the analytics API by exposing a `EnterpriseSubsidyBudget` model to `edx-enterprise-data` (i.e., Django app installed into analytics API service).

This approach allows the analytics API to be able to list all budgets (policies) associated with a Learner Credit subsidy to support the overview page route, while still needing to rely on the analytics API for the detail page route as well.

That said, in the future, we intend to migrate the detail page route from the analytics API to make direct API call(s) to retrieve the requisite data in support of the detail page route. In doing so, we would be introducing inconsistency in data sources between the detail page route and overview page route. As such, we will also need to update the data source for the overview page route once the relevant APIs are available to support the more real-time data source to ensure data consistency across the entire feature.

As it relates to React routing for the Learner Credit Management feature, there will be two primary routes supporting both legacy enterprise offers and new Learner Credit subsdies simulatenously. The page routes are as follows: 

* **Overview**.
    * Both enterprise offer and Learner Credit subsidy: ``/:enterpriseSlug/admin/learner-credit``
* **Detail**.
    * Enterprise offer: ``/:enterpriseSlug/admin/learner-credit/:offerId``
    * Learner Credit subsidy: ``/:enterpriseSlug/admin/learner-credit/:policyUUID``


The Learner Credit Management feature should be aware of whether it's working with a legacy enterprise offer or a new Learner Credit subsidy. By knowing this, we will be able to identify which identifier is provided in the detail page route URL. That is, either the `offerId` (enterprise offer) or a `policyUUID` (Learner Credit policy) and eventually rely on different API sources for the feature depending on whether we're working with an enterprise offer or Learner Credit policy.

The decision tree as it relates to data sources and routing for the Learner Credit Management feature is depicted below:

Consequences
************

* The data source for Learner Credit Management feature will continue to be on the delay baked into the analytics API (i.e., 12 hours at the time of this writing) for the short term while the necessary API to support real-time data source for new Learner Credit is implemented. As a result, some of the work to get budgets (policies) metadata into the analytics API may be superceded in the long term once the data source is swapped to be more transactional or real-time.
* We will need to introduce conditional logic within the Learner Credit Management feature to rely on different data sources (i.e., services and REST APIs) when working with a legacy enterprise offer versus a Learner Credit subsidy.
* We will need to ensure data sources are always consistent between the overview and detail page routes for the Learner Credit Management. Otherwise, there is a good chance data between page route will be different.
* As the current data source for the Learner Credit Management feature used by customers on production is the analytics API, we will continue to support the analytics API in the short term by making it aware of budgets (policies). This will allow us to continue to support the existing feature while we work on the necessary APIs to support transactional data top-down assignments.

Alternatives Considered
***********************

* Continue to rely on the (time-delayed) analytics API long term. This alternative is not ideal as product and UX would like the data to be more real-time for enterprise administrators. We could likely run the data processing more frequently for the analytics API to cut the 12-hour delay down to something more reasonable, but it'd still on a fixed, time delay with is not compatible with the product requirement to respond to user behavior in real-time.
* In the short term, rely directly on the enterprise-access policies REST API to fetch policies associated to the Learner Credit subsidy being viewed on the overview page route. This would allow us to avoid any data replication about budgets (policies) into the data warehouse or analytics API. However, it would may introduce data inconsistencies in the short term, which must be avoided as the feature is already available to customers on production.
* As a more iterative approach, swap over to the transactional, real-time APIs as they become ready for Learner Credit but filter the results based on a specified timestamp (i.e., the `last_updated_date` of the data returned by the analytics API). However, this adds some risk of data inconsistencies between data sources during the iterative migration to the new APIs.
